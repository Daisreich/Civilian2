## Team Fortress 2 for Garry's Mod (formerly known as the Civilian 2 Fork, Team Fortress 2 Gamemode)
Despite my endless efforts to archive and private my TF2 related repositories, This is still supported and won't be affected as it's still an ongoing community project that is attempting to correctly remake Live TF2 in Garry's Mod. Despite it being worked on alone by myself, I'm still hiring and looking for anyone who could help with this project.

The Gamemode that allows you to play TF2 in Gmod! Now frequently updated!
# Warning
This gamemode is **unstable** and needs a lot of fixes. Community fixes are welcome.

### Additional Info
If you're wondering why _Kilburn ended the development was because he had a hard drive failure and lost all his data. I was in talks with some other dude in regards to bringing back the gamemode, but I have not talked to the guy in months, so I'm guessing his branch is dead. - [N?] SmileyFace (A.K.A wango911)
